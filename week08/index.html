        <li>
          When using transform you use different methods such as translate,
          which would move the element by the x and y values input to the
          translate method.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can include transform or translateX or translateY to move an
          element by id or class using css.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can use scale method inside the transform class to make an element
          larger or smaller, in a sense scaling it. example:
          <code>transform: scale(1.5); </code>
        </li>
        <li>
          While there are many methods, one last method is the rotation method
          which will rotate an element, you must use degrees such as
          <code>rotate(10deg)</code>
        </li>
        <li>
          Canvas is a way to create animations and even games on a webpage using
          the <code> < canvas > </code> element.
        </li>
        <li>
          You can use canvas to draw circles, squares and any other items you
          can create using the variable you assign to
          <code>canvas.getContext("2d")</code>
        </li>
        <li>You can even use canvas to draw animations or play video.</li>
        <li>
          There are many uses for canvas, although compared to SVG you can use
          these and the difference is that canvas allows for pixel
          manipulation.<br />
          One downside is that it runs in immediate mode, which is when its done
          creating a shape you can't access that shape anymore.
